## Description
This is a Blog Webiste where you can express your thoughts by writing your own blogs. You have to make your own login Id to proceed further in the website to write,edit and comment on others blogs. You can also review others blogs. You can add mulitple images to your blogs, you can edit and delete your blogs on the go. You can add the location from where you are writing the blog and also location if any is mentioned in the blog. We have used many validations in it so that no field is empty while submitting or editing blogs.
You can also delete your comments and also update images. Images are displayed in the carousel(if multiple are added). We have a cluster map on our home page which shows from where our users are writing the blogs. One can nvagate to a particular blog by clicking on the blog in our cluster map.
